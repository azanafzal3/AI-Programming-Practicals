    "**AI Lab Task: Intrusion Detection AI Agent**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "In this task, students will implement a **Simple Reflex AI Agent** to monitor network traffic and detect potential intrusions. The agent will perceive traffic data, classify it as normal or suspicious, and take appropriate actions based on predefined rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description:**\n",
    "You are tasked with designing and implementing an **Intrusion Detection AI Agent** that can analyze network traffic for signs of potential cyber threats. Your agent will:\n",
    "1. **Perceive** network traffic data (e.g., request rate, anomalies, source IPs, packet size, and protocol type).\n",
    "2. **Classify** traffic as \"normal\" or \"suspicious\" based on predefined rules.\n",
    "3. **Take action** by logging alerts for suspicious traffic.\n",
    "4. **Simulate traffic data** for testing your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Define the Agent Class**\n",
    "- Create a Python class `IntrusionDetectionAgent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a `perceive()` method that analyzes network traffic attributes:\n",
    "  - **Source IP Address**: The IP address of the incoming connection.\n",
    "  - **Request Rate**: The number of requests per second from a given source.\n",
    "  - **Anomalies Count**: A count of unusual behaviors detected (e.g., repeated failed login attempts, unusual access times).\n",
    "  - **Packet Size**: The size of data packets being transmitted.\n",
    "  - **Protocol Type**: The type of protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement an `act()` method that generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Generate Simulated Traffic Data**\n",
    "- Create a function to simulate network traffic.\n",
    "- Each traffic sample should include:\n",
    "  - **Source IP Address** (randomized IPs)\n",
    "  - **Request Rate** (random values within a realistic range of 10 to 200 requests per second)\n",
    "  - **Anomalies Count** (randomized values indicating unusual behavior between 0 to 10)\n",
    "  - **Packet Size** (random values between 100 to 5000 bytes)\n",
    "  - **Protocol Type** (randomly selected from TCP, UDP, ICMP)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Implement Intrusion Detection Logic**\n",
    "- Define a threshold for detecting suspicious traffic:\n",
    "  - If `request_rate > 100`, classify as **suspicious**.\n",
    "  - If `anomalies > 5`, classify as **suspicious**.\n",
    "  - If `packet_size > 4000`, classify as **suspicious**.\n",
    "  - If the **protocol type is ICMP** with a high request rate, classify as **potential DDoS attack**.\n",
    "- Store alerts for suspicious traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Test the Agent**\n",
    "- Run your agent on generated traffic data.\n",
    "- Observe whether it correctly detects suspicious activity.\n",
    "- Print or log alerts for review.\n",
    "\n",
